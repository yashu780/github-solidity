 STEP2 DECLARATION OF SOLIDITY VERSION 
 ^0.8.0  means:
>= 0.8.0  and  < 0.9.0
pragma=> code will be run only during runtime not on compile time 
helps to avoid error during run time 

state variable stores on blockchain like uint x=12;
local variable only stores during function execution like function addnumber{
    int a=12;
    int b=11;
}
global variable are prdefine that are same for all like block.number{tell your block number }
view function take value from block chain like uint num=x;
function{
    12+num;//we have to use view in syntax
}
pure function don't take data from block chain like function{
    a+b;//no data outside function is added so we have to use pure in syntax

}
external keyword is use data outside the chain
